# SwiftUI + IMGLY CE.SDK Image Editor Demo

This is a minimal SwiftUI demo project showcasing integration of [CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK)](https://img.ly) using the `IMGLYUI-swift` package.  
It allows users to pick an image, edit it using CE.SDK (apply filters, crop, add elements), and save both the result and the editing scene for future restoration.
